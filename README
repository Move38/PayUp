Rules for aether mode:
 - Play Pay Up normally. Any extra tiles are placed nearby, by themselves.
 - If your chain lights up RED, either via losing a showdown or inputting incorrectly, disconnect one tile from your chain and place it nearby, by itself.
 - If any disconnected tile lights up WHITE, any players are allowed to place their hand on it. The first player to do so adds it to their chain.
 - Players who lose all of the tiles in their chain are eliminated.
 - The last player left is the winner.
